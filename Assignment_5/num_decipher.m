function text = num_decipher(n, blocks)
    %NUM_DECIPHER Converts a numerical array into a char array (using 2
    %digits per character). To do this, complete the blocks with 0's to 
    %the left so that they all have length = [digits(n) âˆ’ 1], concatenate them,
    %group them two by two, eliminate the possible 30's and / or 0's that 
    %may be at the end and go to letters.
    %   TEXT = NUM_DECIPHER(N, BLOCKS) returns a text string.
    %   - n: natural number needed to determine the length of the blocks.
    %   - blocks: numerical array.
    
    text = '-';
    blocks_length = length(blocks);
    blocks_size = length(num2str(n)) - 1;
    
    % Auxiliar blocks in char type.
    char_blocks = [];
    
    % Specific format for [digits(n) - 1] char arrays.
    format = strcat( strcat('%0', num2str(blocks_size)), '.f');
